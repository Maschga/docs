  To use with EVCC, you need a Volvo account and a Volvo Connected Car API Key.
  To do this, create a new application on the [Account page](https://developer.volvocars.com/account/) and save the primary VCC API key.
  Now publish your application and select the permissions "Connected Vehicle API -> conve:vehicle_relation" and "Energy API -> (everything)" under "Scopes".
  You can use "http://localhost:9999" (or something else unreachable) as the redirect URL for now. The authorization code will be read and entered manually from the browser later.
  Once the application is created, it will be displayed as "Publication under Review". This is not a problem, it still works.
  Then create a token with `evcc token <car-name>` and save the tokens in the configuration. If Evcc crashes due to an invalid refresh token, delete the tokens with `evcc settings` and generate them again.
